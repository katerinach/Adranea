You had a very impressive interview with us, so we are lucky to have you. Of course, you will be learning a lot of things working for us.\n\nAh yes, unfortunately we can’t hire you until you complete the standard training process. This will take about 6 months…or more. Depending on your efforts. Our company philosophy dictates that we reward hard working individuals. \n\n I know exactly how you feel, I too have started from the bottom before venturing into business. It takes a lot of dedication to succeed in this economy. Nonetheless, I won’t bore you any further. I’ll be keeping a close eye on your progress.\n"
